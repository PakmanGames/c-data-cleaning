# Data Cleaning
This was part of *The Data Processing Assignment* of the 2XC3 Development Basics course. In this project I got to learn more about arrays and memory allocation in C. Specifically, I got to experiment with the different ways to dynamically allocate blocks of memory using `malloc()` and `free()`.  
This project uses a sample data set of iris flower's petal length and cleans and prepares the data.
